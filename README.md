# 💸 Online Banking System Using Data Structures (C++)

This project simulates essential banking operations using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It features account management, transactions, history tracking, and undo options with file-based storage—all built using C++.

## 🔧 Features
- 👤 User/Admin Login
- 💰 Cash Deposit & Withdrawal
- 🔁 Transaction History (Stacks)

- 🔍 Account Search (Admin)
- 📊 Balance Sorting (Bubble Sort)
- 📂 File Persistence

## 🛠 Data Structures Used
- Arrays for user data
- Stack for transaction history
- Queue for undo functionality
- Bubble Sort for sorting balances

## 📂 File Structure
- `main.cpp`: Full source code
- `bankdata.txt`: Demo user database (file-based storage)
- `screenshots/`: Visuals of program output (optional)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.cpp` file in any C++ IDE (like DevC++, Visual Studio).
2. Build and run the program.
3. Interact with the terminal-based banking system.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- GUI Integration or website hosting
- Database support (MySQL)
- Encryption for secure data
- Advanced sorting algorithms
